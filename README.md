# openFrameworks to ofelia tutorial series

Adaptation of the openFrameworks tutorials by [**Lewis Lepton**](http://lewislepton.com) for amasing Pure data external **ofelia** (v4.0.0).<br />
Found and explain diferences in original openFrameworks and ofelia methods, used in this course.<br />
Unfortunately addons, used in this tutorials, not available in ofelia for now. And I didn't do videos wich include any addons.
Except `ofxKinnekt`, which was replaced by the standard `ofVideoGrabber` and `ofxAssimpModelLoader`, which was replaced by the standard `ofMesh`.<br />
Instead of the ofxGui GUI I used the built in pure data GUI objects.
And took pure data sound analizing tools for building sound spectrum in 047 and 048 patches.
